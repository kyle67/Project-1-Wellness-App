# Project-1-Wellness-App

For this project each member of the grop will speak technically about the features implemented in this project. The wellness app will have four categories of workouts: Circuit, Weights, Cardio, and Bodyweight. When the user hovers over one of the four buttons they will be given a definition of the style of workout. When the user clicks one of the four buttons they will be redirected to a page that list different types of workouts for that category. 

An API will be implemented to provide users with videos and articles related to the specific workouts in each category.
