# Project-1-Wellness-App    Team Members:Patience Condell, Tayana Jean, J.D. Chumley, Kyle Daniels,

For this project each member of the grop will speak technically about the features implemented in this project. The wellness app will have four categories of workouts: Circuit, Weights, Cardio, and Bodyweight. When the user hovers over one of the four buttons they will be given a definition of the style of workout. When the user clicks one of the four buttons they will be redirected to a page that list different types of workouts for that category. 

An API will be implemented to provide users with videos and articles related to the specific workouts in each category. Additionally a form will be part of the index.html to collect data from users such as interest, location, age, and gender. 
Data will be made persitent by using Firebase to build the app. All developers will explain the agile software development.
